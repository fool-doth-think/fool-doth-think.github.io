        This movie hits all the emotional beats you expect it to and more. It inspired me to follow my dreams. 
        The origin story for Doug Jones is gut wrenching, and instantly makes you care for the character. 
        By having his parents die in the first minute of the movie, we are given a clear motivation for the character. 
        Juxtaposing Doug's life as a dinosaur and his life as a priest against each other succesfully explores 
        the struggle in him between personal beliefs and religious beliefs, the morals that he holds 
        against the morals that he should hold according to the Church.<br><br>

        Doug's arc through the movie, as he learns to follow his heart rather than the word of the lord, demonstrates
        the dangers of organised religion - how it can lead to the needs of the many
        being cast aside in order to fufill the needs and wants of the organisation.
        This message is highlighted in the motivation of the villains - 
        the Chinese Christain drug dealing ninjas - who's goal is to get the city addicted to cocaine, then cut them off
        in order to force them to turn to the Church as their only form of rehab. This story is an allegory for the
        relationship between the Church and it's followers, showing how the creator believes that the Church no longer
        cares about its followers<br><br>

        The film critisizes the Church in some other ways, when Father Stewart takes Doug to an exorcist to eliminate
        the darkness inside him (an exorcist being considered evil by the church), 
        the hypocrisy of the Church is highlighted, highlighting how while the Church condemns
        sinful actions, some, even high up in the Church, still commit these so-called sins.<br><br>

        As well as its powerful message, the movie has a compelling romantic art between the 
        doctor lawyer ninja hooker Carol and the main man Doug. We see how Doug struggles to continues in 
        his faith after falling in love with Carol, and ultimately abandoning it after it rejects him for 
        being his true self (a dinosaur). This could be seen as a potent illustration of how the Church rejected
        LGBTQ+ people, who only wanted to be their true selves.<br><br>

        The movies message is convied effectively by the compelling characters, brilliant writing and
        stunning special effects, the pace is good, getting to the point quickly and effectively without feeling
        rushed. The twist at the end (which i shall not spoil) perfectly ties together the themes of the movie 
        and is impossible to see coming. Ultimately I feel that The Velocipastor is uniquely perfect in its
        execution, aiming for bullseye in every area and hitting it each and every time. I rate it a solid 
        9/10.
